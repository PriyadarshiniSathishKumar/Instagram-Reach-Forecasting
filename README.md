# Instagram-Reach-Forecasting
This Python code analyzes Instagram reach data (assuming a CSV named 'Instagram-Reach.csv') and generates informative visualizations using Plotly.
Key functionalities:

# Data loading and wrangling:
Imports necessary libraries (pandas, plotly).
Reads the CSV data, handling potential encoding issues.
Converts the 'Date' column to datetime format for time-based analysis.

# Trend visualization:
Creates a line chart to visually display the overall trend of Instagram reach over time.
Distribution exploration:
Creates a bar chart to explore reach distribution across days.
Creates a box plot to reveal potential outliers in reach values.

# Day-of-week analysis:
Extracts the day of the week from the 'Date' column.
Calculates mean, median, and standard deviation of reach for each day.
Presents a bar chart summarizing these statistics, aiding in understanding how reach might vary by day of the week.
While forecasting isn't directly implemented in this code, it lays the groundwork to explore potential forecasting methods (like SARIMA or Prophet) by analyzing historical reach patterns. This analysis can inform content strategy decisions to optimize reach for future posts.

# Target audience:

Social media managers and marketing professionals interested in analyzing Instagram reach data.
Data analysts seeking to understand trends and patterns in social media engagement.
